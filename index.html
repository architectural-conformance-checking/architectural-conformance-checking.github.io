                  <h3>Designing Software Architecture</h3>
                  <p>
                    Describing the term software architecture is really a
                    difficult task. We can find several definitions that talk
                    about architectural components, relationships, definitions
                    of organization , distrivuted systems and various other
                    things that talk about how to organize the system to
                    maintain a high level of maintainability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    At the beginning of the development of a system, in general,
                    there is an architecture specification step in order to
                    establish the main components, their interactions and how
                    they will work together to meet the requirements and respect
                    certain constraints.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These components that make up the architecture can be
                    internal layers that were designed with the aim of
                    organizing the code and maintaining maintainability over
                    time. For example, imagine a web system for scheduling
                    medical appointments and that, internally, was organized
                    using layers. A presentation layer (Controllers) responsible
                    for controlling the flow of requests, a service layer
                    (Services) responsible for executing the business logic and
                    a layer called Repositories responsible for accessing data.
                    The layers of this system can be seen in the figure below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.ties.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Note that so far, only layers and their responsibilities
                    have been designed. The next step is to design the
                    interactions between these layers. In the case of the
                    appointment scheduling system, the upper layers make calls
                    to the lower layers. That is, the Controllers layer makes
                    calls to the Services layer and the Services layer makes
                    calls to the Repositories layer. Note that these
                    dependencies are represented by the arrows between the
                    layers in the following image.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.dependencies.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    As stated earlier, designing architecture is about
                    establishing architectural components and how they interact
                    in order to meet requirements and respect constraints. These
                    restrictions are, for example, saying that the controllers
                    layer CANNOT make direct calls to the Repositories layer, as
                    well as the Services layer cannot make calls to the
                    Controllers layer. See how this can happen in the image
                    below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.request.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    If these calls happen, (the calls that should not happen)
                    they are characterized as Architectural Deviations since the
                    implementation deviates from the architecture that was
                    initially planned.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How to Identify Architectural Desviations?</h3>

                  <p>
                    These architectural deviations end up degrading the system
                    over time. Therefore, we need some approach that can compare
                    the planned architecture with the implementation and reveal
                    these architectural deviations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In general, these approaches take as input a description of
                    the architecture that was planned and the actual
                    implementation and compare the two to verify that the
                    implementation is as planned - as shown in the image below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.check.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Generally speaking, this is how architectural conformance
                    checking works. It is worth mentioning that the Planned
                    Architecture is specified in a domain language, allowing
                    this process to be fully automated.
