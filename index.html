                  <h3>EXPLAINING ARCHITECTURAL-CONFORMANCE CHECKING</h3>

                  <p>
                    At the beginning of the development of a system, in general,
                    there is an architecture specification step in order to
                    establish the main components, their interactions and how
                    they work together to meet the requirements and respect
                    certain constraints.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    These components that make up the architecture can be
                    internal layers that were designed with the goal of
                    organizing the code and reaching a good maintainability
                    level over time. For example, imagine a web system for
                    scheduling medical appointments that is internally organized
                    using layers. A Controller layer (Controllers), responsible
                    for controlling the flow of requests; a service layer
                    (Services), responsible for running the business logic and a
                    layer called Repositories, responsible for accessing data.
                    The layers of this system can be seen in the figure below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.ties.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Note that so far, only the layers and their responsibilities
                    were designed. The next step is to design how these layers
                    should communicate. In the case of the appointment
                    scheduling system, the upper layers should only communicate
                    with the lower ones. That is, the Controllers layer should
                    only communicate with the Services layer and the Services
                    layer should only communicate with Repositories layer. Note
                    that these dependencies are represented by the arrows
                    between the layers in the following image.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.dependencies.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    As stated earlier, designing architecture is about
                    establishing architectural components and how they interact
                    in order to meet requirements and respect constraints. These
                    restrictions are, for example, saying that the Controllers
                    layer CANNOT make direct calls to the Repositories layer, as
                    well as the Services layer cannot make calls to the
                    Controllers layer. See how this can happen in the image
                    below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.request.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    In case these calls were found in the current implementation
                    (the calls that should not happen), they are characterized
                    as Architectural Deviations, since the implementation
                    deviates from the architecture and the constraints that
                    should be kept.
                  </p>

                  <h3>How to Identify Architectural Desviations?</h3>

                  <p>
                    These architectural deviations end up degrading the system
                    over time. Therefore, we need an approach to compare the
                    planned architecture with the implementation and reveal
                    these architectural deviations.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In general, these approaches take as input a description of
                    the architecture that was planned and the current
                    implementation and compare them to verify whether the
                    implementation is as it was planned - as shown in the image
                    below.
                  </p>

                  <img src="./images/arch.check.png" class="center" />
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    Generally speaking, this is how architectural conformance
                    checking works. It is worth mentioning that the Planned
                    Architecture is usually specified in a domain-specific
                    language, allowing this process to be fully automated.
